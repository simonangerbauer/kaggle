# Collection of finished Kaggle Challenges

## HuBMAP - Hacking the Kidney
Identify glomeruli in human kidney tissue images.  
[Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-kidney-segmentation/overview)


The code consists of two notebooks, one for training and one for prediction:
* [training.ipynb](./hubmap/hubmap-training.ipynb)
* [prediction.ipynb](./hubmap/hubmap-prediction.ipynb)

Unfortunately, I did not finish the challenge in time, which is why I don't have a validated Dice score on the leaderboard. I did validate it with my own holdout set and achieved a Dice score of 0.909 with that.
